# DMLocalizedNibBundle

`DMLocalizedNibBundle` is [Wil Shipley's localization system](http://wilshipley.com/blog/2009/10/pimp-my-code-part-17-lost-in.html) with improvements to support localization of:

- all `NSTabView` items and their labels
- columns in `NSTableView` and `NSOutlineView`
- display patterns (`%{value1}`, `%{value2}`, ...) in `NSTextField` strings

## How to use

**Important**: These instructions are for Xcode 3

First create a target for the command-line tool that will slurp out the localizable strings from source files and XIB files:

1. In Xcode choose Project > New Target
2. On the left select "Cocoa" under the Mac OS X heading
3. On the right select Shell Tool and click Next
4. For the Target Name enter "xibLocalizationPostprocessor" and click Finish
5. Choose Project > Add to Project
6. In the file browser choose the xibLocalizationPostprocessor.m file and click Add
7. Under Add To Targets list select only xibLocalizationPostprocessor and deselect all others


Next set the above command-line tool to be compiled with the application:

1. In the Groups & Files pane double-click your application target
2. Under the Direct Dependencies list click +
3. Select xibLocalizationPostprocessor and click Add Target


Then add a build script that will call the above command-line tool:

1. In the Groups & Files pane select your application target
2. Choose Project > New Build Phase > New Run Script Build Phase
3. In the Script text view enter

	`/path/to/slurpLocalizableStrings.zsh`
	
	For example if you have the localization project as a subfolder in the Xcode project folder:

	`${SRCROOT}/DMLocalizedNibBundle/slurpLocalizableStrings.zsh`
4. Close the script info window
5. Ctrl-Click on the newly create build script phase (it should be called "Run Script") and choose Rename
6. Type "Generate Localizable Strings" and hit enter


And finally add the dynamic localization loader into your application target:

1. In the Groups & Files pane select your application target
2. Choose Project > Add to Project
3. In the file browser choose `DMLocalizedNibBundle.m` and click Add
4. Under Add To Targets list select only your application target and deselect all others
