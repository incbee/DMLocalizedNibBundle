# DMLocalizedNibBundle

`DMLocalizedNibBundle` is [Wil Shipley's localization system](http://wilshipley.com/blog/2009/10/pimp-my-code-part-17-lost-in.html) with improvements to support localization of:

- columns in `NSTableView` and `NSOutlineView`
- display patterns (`%{value1}`, `%{value2}`, ...) in `NSTextField` strings

## How to use

First create a target for the command-line tool that will slurp out the localizable strings from source files and XIB files:

1. In Xcode choose Project > New Target
2. On the left select "Cocoa" under the Mac OS X heading
3. On the right select Shell Tool and click Next
4. For the Target Name enter "xibLocalizationPostprocessor" and click Finish
5. Choose Project > Add to Project
6. In the file browser choose the xibLocalizationPostprocessor.m file and click Add
7. Under Add To Targets list select only xibLocalizationPostprocessor and deselect all others
